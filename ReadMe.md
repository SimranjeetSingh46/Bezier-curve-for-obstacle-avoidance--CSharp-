# Task Description
### Research Project of Simranjeet Singh

## Final Goal
- GUI to simulate overtaking of a obstacle
- describe obstacles (cars) by state vector (x,y,v,w,l)
- input obstacle and ego state
- determine planned path using Bezier curves based on collision avoidance
- time based simulation of ego state along the planned path
